# SecuredPasswordChecker it is the most secured password checker
it uses hash1 generator
their is no one to trust but yourself 
in order to check the your own password was ever been hacked
first we change our password to hash1
then using the first five charactor of hash1password we send a request to check if there is a  hacked password before that begans with those five charactor 
# remember we only send only five charctor to the server so litrarly no one can gusses our password 
so finally we check our hash1password and the one we get from server list when we get the match we print out the count
